# OxNet Science Programme: Gene Expression

This is the README file for the OxNet Science Programme seminar delivered by Holly Roach about X chromosome inactivation.
If you are on the OxNet programme and have any questions about the data or code, please talk to the OxNet support team or get in touch with Paddy McDevitt (OxNet Science Coordinator).

# Code

You are provided with a Jupyter notebook in  [OxNet_Genetic_Regulation_Notebook.ipynb](OxNet_Genetic_Regulation_Notebook.ipynb).
This notebook provides the Python code necessary to load the data and manipulate it in various ways.

# The Homework Exercise

For the homework you should work through the provided Jupyter notebook, reading each entry and doing your best to understand each cell of Python code.
Feel free to edit the code, or run additional tests, as you wish. There are several challenges and tasks set out in this notebook.
However, you will likely find it easier to write your own code in a new notebook which you will then later submit as part of the Easter Competition.
